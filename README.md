### MiddleGround

MiddleGround is an app that helps friends meet together in a central location, so no one has to travel disproportionately far. What makes this app unique is that it finds a central meeting place based on the traveling _time_ it takes, not distance.

Although a place might be equidistant between points A and B, the travel time may vary based on local roads, highways, traffic lights, etc.

This app attempts to solve that problem while also suggesting restaurants within proximity of the meeting area.
